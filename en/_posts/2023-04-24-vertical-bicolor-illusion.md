A rectangle divided into parts is perceived differently.

For example, with two horizontal stripes of contrasting colors, it appears *wider*, while with three vertical stripes, it appears *longer*.

Try creating an elongated rectangle on the body and divide it vertically into 3 segments using 2 contrasting colors. At the point of their connection, the body will visually shrink and elongate.[^vbi-0030026]

It is not recommended to divide the colors horizontally, as it reduces height.

The same technique can be used for the face. The hair on the sides splits the head into 3 parts, and as a result, the face narrows.
