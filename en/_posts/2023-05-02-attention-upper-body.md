Body evaluation can change due to the observer's attention shift.

When an object attracts our attention, the brain increases its *contrast and brightness*,[^aub-200411001] causing us to observe it more carefully and underestimate the others.

Studies show that when looking at a person, our attention is often directed towards specific areas, such as the stomach.[^aub-200904003] For instance, men tend to focus slightly higher, on the chest area, while women tend to focus on the waist.

Try to direct the observer's attention to your neck and head. There is a peculiarity that the line of vision is attracted to the noticeable part. For example, you can achieve this by selecting accessories such as **glasses, brooches, and also a hairstyle**. A more saturated color is better, for example, red or any reflective color.[^aub-101093]

Remove accentuating details below the waist.

You will have a higher eye line, and the brain may mistake it for a taller height.[^aub-553348]

You can also redirect attention from an undesirable body part to a more favorable one. In one experiment, women with facial paralysis improved facial symmetry with the help of hairstyles and makeup.[^aub-9581393]
