The protein encoded by the FGFR3 gene inhibits the division of growth plate cells.

Normally, it works to prevent very high growth, but with mutations, a person grows very short.

In 2021, BioMarin created the drug called *Vosoritide*, which regulates FGFR3. It contains a **C-type natriuretic peptide** (CNP) analog. This substance turns off the creation of the FGFR3 protein.

The drug was approved by the EMA and FDA for the treatment of dwarfism and is already in use.

As a result, scientists predict that children will reach the same heights as their healthy peers.

*Will it work on healthy people?*

If the growth zones are still unfused, probably yes.

CNP acts as a growth stimulant, not only in sick people. Overexpression of CNP in humans and animals is associated with enhanced skeletal growth, while insufficient expression leads to growth delay.[^gtc-34758467]

But since the drug is new, its impact on healthy people is not yet well studied.
