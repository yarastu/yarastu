Objects appear connected when similar in color and brightness.

A style of one color and its shades is called *monochromatic*.

When scanning a monochromatic outfit, our eyes move seamlessly. For example, using the same color for pants, socks, and shoes visually elongates the legs. The pants blend into the shoes, creating the illusion of increased height.

However, if an object is interrupted during vertical scanning, the eyes stops, and the perceived height decreases.
