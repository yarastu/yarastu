The more a bone is loaded, the better it grows.

This leads to interesting results. For example, violinists have longer fingers, tennis and handball players have  longer a dominant hand, jumpers and athletes have stronger leg bones.[^sciencebuddies][^26850513][^26607734] They all load different bones, which eventually lengthen.

At the same time, when overloaded, growth will slow down.

There are 2 sources of load:[^18787052]

- **Gravity**. We experience its effects constantly.
- **Muscles**. Muscle tension compresses and decompresses the skeleton during physical activity.

Gravity is the main helper in strengthening bones and accumulating minerals in them. To fully utilize it, make *jumping and striking* movements.

A hypogravitational environment better promotes elongation. For example, in water, we do not have to overcome vertical resistance, and at the same time, *muscles can push bones to lengthen*. Looks good, right? But the downside is that this often does not lead to bone strengthening.

The more the bones lengthen, the more you need to accumulate minerals in them. Otherwise, you risk suffering from fractures, especially in old age.
