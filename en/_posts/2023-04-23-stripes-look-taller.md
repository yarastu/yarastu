Which of the two squares is *higher*?

Our stereotypical thinking should suggest that the left one. But here's how our brain sees them.

This is the *Helmholtz illusion*. In reality, vertical lines appear wider, and horizontal lines appear taller.[^slt-25784870]

Researchers applied this principle to clothing, and it has been found to work the same way, at least for slim body types.[^slt-34397290][^slt-24349693]

Single horizontal and vertical lines work in another way. When a single line divides the silhouette into a few vertical parts, a person appears taller, and with horizontal division, they appear shorter.[^slt-030026]

The optimal choice seems to be wearing thin horizontal lines or single vertical line that divide your outfit into 3 vertical segments.
