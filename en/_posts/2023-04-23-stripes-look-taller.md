Which of the two squares is *higher*?

Our stereotypical thinking should suggest that the left one. But here's how our brain sees them.

In reality, horizontal lines appear to be higher by about 5% - an effect discovered by *Helmholtz*. And if you combine them, the illusion will be even stronger.[^slt-25784870]

Researchers applied this principle to clothing, and it has been found to work the same way, at least for slim body types.[^slt-34397290]

However, the power of stereotypes should not be underestimated. Many of us have heard recommendations to wear vertical lines if we are short or overweight. This may lead to a biased attitude towards horizontal stripes.

Therefore, for a slim body, it seems optimal to wear thin horizontal lines that are broken up by no more than 2-3 vertical segments.

For wider body sizes, use vertical thin stripes.[^slt-24349693]
