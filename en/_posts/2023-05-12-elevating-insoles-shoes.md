Ratio of leg length to height varies among people of different heights.

Taller individuals tend to have longer legs relative to their overall height compared to individuals of average and shorter stature.[^eis-10257]

These proportions can serve as cues of an individual's height, and we consider a person with longer legs to be taller.

You can try lengthening your legs with special insoles and shoes. Optimal choice could be shoes with sole thickness of 2-3 cm along with **insert of 3-5 cm**. However, excessive height increases risk of health problems.

> a shoe insole measuring >5 cm could excessively shift the plantar pressure to the front of the foot[^eis-282601]

Choose insoles **with cushioning and arch support** as they absorb shocks during movement and spread your body's weight evenly on the feet. For high-heeled shoes, it is recommended to use custom-made insoles.
