Which of the vertical lines in the pictures is longer?

Are you thinking it's the left one, right? Most people would agree with you.

> when vertical lines disrupt the horizontal lines, the horizontal lines would look shorter while the vertical lines look longer[^wfi-201329]

Here we are dealing with the Wundt-Fick illusion or the inverted *T*. The upper rectangle divides the lower one into 3 parts, which makes the lower one appear shorter than the upper one, even though they are actually equal in length.[^wfi-0030026]

You can stretch the necessary parts on your body by forming the letter T on them. Note that the vertical stripe should be wide enough to create a noticeable separation.
