Zinc is one of the most important nutrients involved in bone formation.

Together with IGF-1, they stimulate growth zones, and together with vitamin D, they fill the bones with minerals.[^37002364]

For children up to 5 years old, a dose of 10 mg of zinc sulfate per day for 24 weeks will result in a growth of 0.46 cm more than with a placebo. Similar results, but with a dosage of up to 20 mg, are observed in early adolescence.[^19472600]

Often there is no need to take dietary supplements if you consume zinc with food. For example, *meat, fish, nuts* contain enough zinc.

If you do not reach the daily requirement, then take **10-20 mg of zinc sulfate** for a minimum of 6 months or during periods of active growth. Increase the dosage to 20-30 mg if you sweat a lot, as zinc is lost through sweat.

And keep in mind this:
> addition of iron decreases the positive effect of zinc supplementation on linear growth through potential interference with absorption or bio-availability.[^21501440]

Do not combine zinc with iron or calcium *at the same time*. They compete for absorption.
