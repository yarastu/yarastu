Shape of a specific part extends to the neighboring part.

This effect is called *shape echo*.

#### Choose clothing with suitable shapes

For example, round neckline on a garment can make your face appear rounder, while V-neckline can make your face taper towards the chin.

#### Raising eyebrows can elongate your face

{% include image.html name="shape-echo-eyebrows" alt="Raising eyebrows can lift the eyes" %}

Researchers have found that when outer corners of eyebrows are raised, outer corners of eyes also lift. This results in more defined cheekbones and chin, and face appears longer.

> slanting the eyebrows by 16° caused a perceived slanting of the eyes by 3° in the same direction.[^sei-0030026]

It is likely that similar result can be achieved with shape of eyeglass frames.

#### Neck and face also reflect each other

By exposing neck, you can visually make it appear thinner, and face smaller. On contrary, wearing sweater with thick collar will broaden face. This is not desirable, especially if face is already wide.
