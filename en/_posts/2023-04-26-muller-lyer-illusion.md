An arrow line appears shorter than a line of the same length with tails — Müller-Lyer illusion.

Experiment with arrows in clothing. For example, a V-shaped skirt or swimsuit will elongate the legs.

V-shaped collars and tops will vertically elongate the upper body.

You can apply eye makeup to visually increase them. [^mli-0030026]
