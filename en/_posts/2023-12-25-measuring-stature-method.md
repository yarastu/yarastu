We reach our maximum height right after waking up.

After sleep, intervertebral discs straighten, and muscles restored. We are full of energy and maintain maximum height for about 2 hours.

Throughout the day, the spine compresses, and muscles get tired. We lose up to 3 cm, mainly in the torso.[^msm-774319]

Therefore, to measure height correctly, take into account the diurnal variations in stature. Try the following.

#### In the second half of the day

Available data confirms that a more accurate measurement of height is obtained approximately 6 hours after waking up, as height reduction often stops by this time. Measure growth at the same time on different days.

#### Repeat multiple times

Take at least 2 measurements with a 5-minute interval.[^msm-400000101] If the results differ by more than 2 mm, repeat the attempt. Aim for close numbers.

#### Choose similar days

Measurements will be incorrect if one is after a daytime nap or swimming, and another is after sedentary work or a day on your feet. Choose days when activity and rest are approximately the same.

#### In the same way

Repeat measurements should be done by the same person, using the same measuring device and method.[^msm-783422]

#### Use one method

It's better to have someone else assist you. The technique is as follows:[^msm-122166]

1. Stand straight without shoes and socks.
2. The shoulder blades and buttocks touch the vertical backboard of the stadiometer.
3. Keep heels together, and feet at a 30–45° angle.
4. Relax your arms, palms facing your torso.
5. Pull your chin slightly toward your body and stretch upward. The line between your eye sockets and ear canal (*frankfurt plane*) should be parallel to the floor.
6. Look straight ahead.
7. Take the measurement.
