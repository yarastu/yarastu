How *important* is it for you to grow?

If you see this as a worthwhile goal and are ready to invest time and effort, your chances of success will increase.

In Gary McPherson's experiment, children who approached their goals with seriousness and a long-term mindset achieved greater results than those who were less committed, even if they practiced less frequently.

You can become even more effective by taking active action.

> When a person, in addition to having a serious attitude, engages in intensive practice, their results increase by 400% compared to those who consider their activities secondary and unimportant.[^EricWeiner]

We have chosen a challenging goal because bones grow slowly and it's not always easy. Embrace this from the very beginning and be prepared to do your best.
