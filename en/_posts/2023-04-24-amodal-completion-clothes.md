Our brain loves to predict.

Which image do you think has slimmer legs?

{% include image.html name="slim-leg-illusion" alt="The illusion of leg thickness" %}

In reality, it is the same character, but we perceive the legs as longer in the right picture, don't we?

This is explained by *amodal completion*, where our mind mentally fills in missing parts of an object that we cannot see fully. We latch onto neighboring areas and try to guess what is hidden.

#### Show a narrow area
To create the illusion of narrower and elongated limbs, expose their slimmest parts. For example, **3/4 sleeves and cropped pants** reveal the thinnest parts of the arms and legs, making them slimmer.

#### Make the visible area longer
When the visible part of the leg is long, the entire leg looks longer. Research shows that a **skirt above the knee** can make legs appear 5% longer.[^acc-0030026]

Similarly, **short sleeve shirts** elongate the arms.
