Body width influences judgments about height and vice versa.

In one study, participants more often described narrow bodies as taller, even though they were the same height and only differed in width.

Somehow, our brain knows that thinness and tallness are associated. Therefore, when we see thin people, our brain overestimates their height.

> our data suggest that height and width are not only integral, but that variations in one can produce illusory perception of the other[^tpt-01304548]

Maintain a slim silhouette through visual techniques and, if possible, reduce excess weight.
