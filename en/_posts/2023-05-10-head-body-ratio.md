On which picture does a person appear taller?

Scientists showed similar pictures to participants and found that the person on the left appears taller. In reality, their height is the same, only the size of the head differs.

When assessing height, we consider the ratio of head height — from the chin to the crown — to the entire stature.

On average, the height of an adult person is approximately 8 of their heads, while in younger age, the head is proportionally larger.[^hbr-7031047]

> bodies with proportionally larger heads could be perceived as less mature and, thusly, shorter [^hbr-2018158]

Research shows that taller individuals have a smaller head-to-body ratio, while shorter individuals have a larger ratio.[^hbr-101068] For example, at a height of 170 cm, the average head size for men is 22.4 cm (1/7.6), while at 177 cm, it is 22.1 cm (1/8). For men who are 186 cm tall, the head height may be 20.4 cm (1/9).

#### Practical recommendations
- Our goal is to create a head-to-height ratio of about **1/8 to 1/9** as much as possible. Don't make your head too small, as it reduces attractiveness, especially for men.[^hbr-201207001]
- Adjust your hairstyle. If you have a large head, avoid voluminous hairstyles and long beards. You may visually reduce the size of your face with **bangs and a small amount of stubble**, as covering facial outlines narrows its appearance.[^hbr-0030026]
- Wear shoes that increase your height. With longer legs, your head will appear smaller, and your overall height will appear taller.
