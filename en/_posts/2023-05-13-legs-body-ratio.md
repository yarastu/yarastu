On average, adult legs are about half of their height.

Preserving these proportions is important to maintain harmony and overall body perception.

> more extreme values are avoided because they could be indicative of diseases and other maladaptive conditions.[^lbr-01506359]

A leg-to-body ratio of 50/50 indicates good health and is generally perceived positively. Women's legs that are slightly longer than average by about 5% are also considered attractive.[^lbr-200709002] This is because, by nature, women tend to have longer legs relative to their torso compared to men. On the other hand, long legs on men are not typically seen as attractive.[^lbr-200608003]

It is recommended to adjust the waistline. When wearing high-heeled shoes, try lowering the waistline if necessary, for example, with an elongated jacket. A cropped top will create the opposite effect. Tucking in a shirt into pants will also raise the waistline.
