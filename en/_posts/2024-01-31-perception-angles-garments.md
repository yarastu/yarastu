They are parallel, but we perceive them as curved inwards — this is the *Wundt illusion*.

The acute angles at the intersection of the red and blue lines appear wider to us than they actually are, so the farther from the center, the more distance between red lines.[^pag-323918]

If you apply such a drawing to the road, drivers perceive it as narrow. In one study, this led to a decrease in speed before a dangerous curve.[^pag-38008924739]

To elongate the silhouette and make some body parts look slimmer, try the following arrow prints in clothing[^pag-164304].
